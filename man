#cd: cd
  Change the current working directory within the shell.

  By specifying the DIR argument, you can set the current directory to a new location. If no DIR is provided, the default 
  directory is set to the value of the HOME shell variable.

  The CDPATH variable defines a search path for the directory containing DIR. Multiple alternative directory names in CDPATH 
  are separated by colons (':'). An empty directory name in CDPATH represents the current directory. If DIR begins with a 
  slash ('/'), CDPATH is not used in the directory change process.

  Exit Status:
  Returns a 0 if the directory is successfully changed, and if $PWD is appropriately set when using the -P option; 
  otherwise, it returns a non-zero status.

#env: env
  Print the current environment.

  Options:
  NONE

  Output the environment to the standard output.

#alias: alias
  Define or display command aliases.

  When invoked without arguments, 'alias' prints the list of aliases in the reusable format 'alias NAME=VALUE' on the       
  standard output.

  With additional arguments, an alias is created for each NAME, and its VALUE is specified.
  If there is a trailing space in VALUE, the next word is examined for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.

  Options:
  NONE

  Exit Status:
  Returns a true status unless a NAME is provided for which no alias has been defined.

#help: help
  Retrieve information about built-in commands.

  Displays concise summaries of built-in commands. If a PATTERN is
  specified, it offers detailed help on all commands matching PATTERN; 
  otherwise, it prints the list of available help topics.

  Exit Status:
  Returns success unless PATTERN is not found or an invalid option is provided.

#history: history
  View or manipulate the command history list.

  Displays the command history list with line numbers, marking each modified entry with an asterisk (*). If you provide an argument N, it lists only the last N entries.

  Exit Status:
  Returns success unless an invalid option is used or an error occurs.
